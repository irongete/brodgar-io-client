### D-007 — Everything is in English ✅
**Decision.** English is the project's only language: the conversation, all `specs/**`
documents, the docs, and the code and its comments.
**Rationale.** Maintainer preference.

### D-026 — Gap design/build order ✅ (closes Q-014)
Order: **widget-tree-read mechanism** ([14-widget-tree-reads.md](../design/14-widget-tree-reads.md), foundational)
→ A5 overlays (done) → A1 map/markers → A4 study/curiosity/FEP → A3 action bar → A2 radar/GobIcon settings
→ A11 slash commands → A6–A10. Rationale: the widget-tree mechanism unblocks vitals/buffs/char/FEP/
action bar at once ([coverage-gaps.md](../ROADMAP.md) B1/C2), so it comes first.
