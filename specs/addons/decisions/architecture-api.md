### D-008 — The engine lives in `src/io/brodgar/addon/`; Lua is a stable facade ✅
**Decision.** Engine + bridge live in a new `io.brodgar.addon` package. Addons target a stable
Lua facade (`hafen.*`) and never touch `haven.*` directly. `haven`-package helpers are used only
where package-private access is required.
**Rationale.** Isolates upstream churn (P1); enables complete resource ownership/teardown (P2);
mirrors the non-invasive voice-integration pattern.
**See.** [01-architecture.md](../design/01-architecture.md).

### D-011 — Invasiveness is acceptable where it yields materially better features ✅
**Decision.** The earlier "minimize core edits" priority is **relaxed**. The addon system may edit
the `haven` core (add first-class hook points, hookable subclasses, dispatch instrumentation)
when doing so enables substantially better capabilities. Minimal-edit seams are still preferred
*when equivalent*, but are no longer a hard constraint.
**Rationale.** User direction: for the addon system, good features outweigh strict
non-invasiveness. Enables a proper hook/interception system (pre/post/replace, `preventDefault`).
**Consequences.** Supersedes the strict framing of [G10](../design/00-vision-scope.md); the invasiveness
ledger ([11-core-hooks.md](../design/11-core-hooks.md)) becomes a *record* of edits, not a *budget*. Still
keep edits centralized and tagged (`// addon:`) so upstream merges stay manageable.
**See.** [13-hooks-and-interception.md](../design/13-hooks-and-interception.md).

### D-012 — Reference-based reads, ONE flat calling style, unified under `hafen.gob` ✅
**Decision.** Entities are addressed by an explicit **reference**, like WoW unit tokens — not
implicit global state. A **GobRef** is a gob id (number) or a token (`"player"`, `"partyN"`,
`"target"`). There is **exactly one** calling style: a **flat accessor** `hafen.gob.<attr>(ref)`
(e.g. `hafen.gob.health("player")`) — **no** parallel handle/OO style for gobs ([D-013](architecture-api.md)).
All per-gob reads live under **`hafen.gob.*`**; `hafen.player`/`hafen.char`/`hafen.party` hold only
data with no per-gob equivalent. Reference accessors **re-resolve each call** (fresh; nil if gone);
**snapshots** (bulk enumeration via `hafen.world.gobs`) are point-in-time copies. **Items/widgets**
are addressed by **handles** (no stable token).
**Rationale.** Matches the WoW model the user referenced; a single canonical way ([D-013](architecture-api.md));
avoids stale-pointer bugs; fits Hafen (gobs have a stable `long id` and can despawn).
**Open.** The exact **token set** (`"mouseover"`? others) and item addressing — [Q-013](../DECISIONS.md).
**See.** [API-REFERENCE.md](../API-REFERENCE.md).

### D-013 — One canonical way per operation (no dual APIs) ✅
**Decision.** The Lua API exposes **exactly one** way to do each thing; we do not ship parallel
styles for the same operation (e.g. flat accessor vs handle-method for gob reads). For gob reads,
the chosen way is the flat reference accessor ([D-012](architecture-api.md)).
**Rationale.** User preference: *"no quiero ofrecer dos formas de hacer las cosas."* Smaller
surface, less to document, fewer ways to get subtly wrong.
**Consequences.** Handles still exist where they are the *only* natural model (items, windows) —
that is the one way for those, not a duplicate. Applies to all future API-surface decisions.

## Design-closure decisions (resolve all open questions)

### D-020 — Namespaced `hafen.*` only, no flat globals ✅ (closes Q-011)
API is namespaced (`hafen.gob.health(ref)`), no flat-global aliases (`GobHealth`). Avoids `_G`
pollution, is discoverable, and sandboxes cleanly. Terseness comes from the token, not the name.

### D-022 — Token set + items handle-only ✅ (closes Q-013)
Tokens: `"player"`, `"party1".."partyN"` (ordered by `Member.seq`), `"target"` (combat only).
`"mouseover"` **deferred** (needs hover hit-test tracking — a later phase). Items are addressed
**by handle only** (no `(container,slot)` alternative), honoring [D-013](architecture-api.md).
